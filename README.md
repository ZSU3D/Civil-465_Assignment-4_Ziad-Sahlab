# Civil-465_Assignment_4_Ziad-Sahlab
 This repository contains the code for assignment 4 of the introduction to research skills class.  The code calculates the deformations and internal member forces of truss elements. The output is an internal force vector for the truss members and a displcement vector for the nodes. The code also plots the deofrmed shape of the truss.

## Runing the code
This code was written in Matlab, therefore, it requires Matlab to be run. Matlab can be downloaded and installed using the instructions in the following link https://ch.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html.

As Matlab requires a subscription, an alternative open-source software called Octave can be used instead.
Octave can be downloaded here: https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/download.

Once either Matlab or Octave are installed, the files in the repository can be downloaded as a .zip file. It should then be extracted in one folder.

The file titled 'truss_deformation_solver' should then be run and the code will automatically calculate everything.

## Data 
The two bridges in the data file can be analyzed using the same code with the change of path highlighted in the comments of the 'truss_deformation_solver' file.
